Form validation involves ensuring that the data entered by users in a form meets specific criteria and is valid. 
Its purpose is to prevent the submission of incomplete or invalid data.
In this project i have created a responsive form using HTML ,CSS and for the form validation i have applied javascript. 
Additionally, i've illustrated how to show or hide password visibility on the toggle button click.
